OneSignal server API wrapper for PHP. No third-party dependency.

There are several packages for OneSignal, but some rely on third-party library or certain framework components. That's reason of this project.

I will take time to complete these in a few days.

## Installation:

install via composer:

```composer install dropfan/onesignal-server-api```

Of course you can clone this project manually then move it into your projects.

```git clone https://github.com/DropFan/onesignal-server-api.git```

But for simple use (Just pass parameters via array rather than Object/Class) you can move OneSignal.php into your projects only.

## Usage:
You can follow the offical ducumention from OneSignal.
